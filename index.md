The processes initiated by Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492 brought
four continents and three "races" into interaction where there had been
little or no communication. Those contacts, in many ways, profoundly
shaped the world in which we live today. One could argue that the
origins of modern democracy and capitalism and of modern racism and
imperialism lie in the development of the Atlantic World. Drawing
together the histories of Europe, Africa, and the Americas, this course
explores the origins, development, and meanings of this new Atlantic
World created as a consequence of the Colombian encounter. To do so we
will focus on the lives of the women and men who inhabited that world
from the 15^th^-century through the Abolitionist movements that marked
the 19^th^ century. Throughout the course, we will emphasize comparative
analyses of historical events and trends. Topics will include imperial
expansion and colonization; the volatile exchange of crops, goods and
pathogens across the Atlantic Ocean; European-Amerindian relations,
European-African relations; slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade;
the growth of mercantile capitalism and the establishment of an Atlantic
economy; the maturation of Euro-American colonial societies and their
struggles for autonomy and national independence.

<u>Objectives:</u> The primary objectives of this course are to
strengthen our critical, historical, and empathetic thinking skills; to
articulate complex and compelling arguments based on available evidence;
and, to hone our ability to express those arguments and ideas in written
and oral form.

History is best understood as a conversation between a series of diverse
arguments and not the simple rote memorization of names, places, and
dates that are so often associated with the discipline. Therefore, the
course is designed such that -

1)  You become better able to articulate and analyze the various
    historical forces which shaped the trajectory of Atlantic World
    history.

2)  You come to understand the varied experiences of the people who
    inhabited the Atlantic World over time *and* the various factors
    (such as race, ethnicity, class, and/or gender) that might explain
    potential differences in their experiences.

3)  You hone your skills at interpreting historical sources and the
    historical literature, learning to identify and critique the
    various explicit and implicit arguments within such sources.

4)  You hone your skills on articulating complex and yet answerable
    questions.

5)  You sharpen your skills at expressing your informed conclusions
    about any topic in written and oral form.

**What I want for you -**

*CRITICAL THINKING AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION - I want to know what YOU,
not others and not computers, think about a question/problem. And, I
want to help YOU refine your ability to communicate those amazing
thoughts in written and oral form.*

*INFORMATION LITERACY and ACTIVE READING - These are core components of
the skills above. We have to work to figure out what a source says; why
it says it; what it doesn't say; why it doesn't say it; and, how all of
those answers help us interpret, engage, and use a source.*

**<u>Course Requirements:</u>**

<u>Readings</u>: There are three types of readings for this
course that are available in different ways. In history, we distinguish
between primary, secondary, and tertiary sources. Primary sources were
written at or near the time under consideration. Secondary sources are
historical analyses written well after the event under consideration
using primary sources. And finally, tertiary sources are background
information (such as textbooks and/or encyclopedia entries).

Required readings for the course are listed on the syllabus. Readings
will be available from two sources: 1) the assigned books; or, 2) via
hyperlink from the Blackboard syllabus.

You will notice a number of **TBDs** on the reading schedule. This is
due to the fact that I have stopped using an expensive reader and due to
the pandemic have not yet been able to obtain the readings. I will be
adding those throughout the semester.

**Books Available for Purchase:**

**Required:**

Timothy Shannon, *Atlantic Lives: A Comparative Approach to Early
America,* 2^nd^ ed, (New York: Pearson Longman, 2019) (Listed as
*Atlantic Lives* on syllabus).

Randy Sparks, *The Two Princes of Calabar: An Eighteenth-century
Odyssey* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 2008).

**Recommended:**

Douglas Egerton, et al, *The Atlantic World: A History, 1400-1888*
(Wheeling, Ill.: Harlan Davidson, Inc, 2007)

Students are expected to have completed the assigned reading **prior**
to the class period for which they are assigned. **Failure to bring**
the *required* readings to class will count as an absence and students
will earn zero credit for contribution that day.

*For proper citation style for the readings from **Atlantic Lives**
please see the citation guide following the weekly schedule.*

**<u>Assignments and Grade Breakdown</u>**

<u>Informal Assignments</u> -- Approximately once or twice a
week, you will be asked to complete short informal assignments. This
might take the form of informal in-class writing assignments, in-class
reading quizzes, and/or short online assignments before or after class.
The purpose of these assignments is not to "trick you" but rather to
provide incentive to keep up with the work and to assess your learning
throughout the semester. More often than not, these will be short
exercises available on Canvas. Please pay special attention to the
notifications on Canvas and any emails from me through Canvas. I will
work to announce any such work in advance. However, I reserve the right
to assign in-class pop-quizzes should I deem it necessary.

These will be graded on a zero-credit, half-credit, three quarters
credit, or full-credit basis (0, ✔, ✔+, +) based on the evidence of
preparation, knowledge, and critical thinking you demonstrate in your
responses. Students will be allowed to drop 15% of your lowest scores on
these assignments (thus, if we have 20 throughout the semester, you will
be able to drop 3)

**<u>Papers:</u>**

**Paper format --** All papers must be in 12-point font, double-spaced,
and include footnotes in *Chicago Manual of Style, 17^th^ ed.* format,
no bibliography or title pages. You will submit all papers on Canvas,
and only Word docs (files ending in .doc or .docx will be accepted).

***Please see the instructions after the course schedule for proper
citations of individual readings in the two readers*.**

Failure to bring a complete draft to the Paper Workshops will result in
a **penalty of a full letter grade on the assignment**.

<u>*Primary Source Analyzes*:</u>
Your task is to analyze a
primary source (or set of connected sources) in its/their historical
context and to assess its/their value for your understanding of the past
in a short (**750 -word max, excluding notes**) paper. Please follow the
style guidelines above. You will complete two such papers early in the
semester.

On each paper please include the following: Name, date, and Word Count
in the upper left-hand corner followed by the title centered on the
page.

**Primary Source Analyses Due Dates**

**Paper 1** (on primary source readings through 9/8)

**Due:** Complete Draft (in-class): Mon, Sept 11 (please upload a copy
and bring a printed copy to class)

**Due**: Final Draft - Friday, Sept 15 (via Canvas)

**Paper 2** (on readings from 9/13-9/25):

**Due**: 9/27 (via Canvas)

Your Assignment -- *Convince* *a professor of Atlantic World History as
to why she should consider using this source in her class. **How does
this source help us understand Atlantic World History?***

Approach this assignment as if you are the first person to have
discovered your primary source; and you wish to express what it
contains, and its meaning(s) and significance to a fellow historian (me
and your classmates) who has not read the source in question. In
addition, you should consider what the document *doesn't say*: what
can't it tell us? What sort of questions do the sources raise that can
only be answered with other sources, primary or secondary?

**You might start with the format:**

>{Author X} wrote {Source Title} in {year} to
argue/demonstrate/theorize {some ideas}. {Author X's} ideas provide
important insight into how {x worked, happened, thought, developed}.

Another way to approach this question is this --

Why did this particular <u>author</u> write about this
particular <u>issue</u> in this particular <u>time</u>
and particular <u>place</u>? What particular <u>arguments were
they making</u> about the Atlantic world or an element
thereof? And, what particular <u>arguments</u> does it allow
<u>us</u> to make about Atlantic World history or an element
thereof?

Most importantly, you need to situate the document within the general
questions of our class. How does it help you articulate, and potentially
answer, the questions most central to our studies?

Your analysis should focus on why this document was written, the meaning
and potential implications of the document in the context of colonial
Latin America, and the assumptions and arguments that form the basis of
the document. ***This is not meant to be a summary, but a presentation
of arguments - tell the reader why the source is important not "what it
says." An excellent summary with no interpretation can earn no higher
than a C.***

*<u>Interpretive Historical Essays</u>***:**

You will be responsible for writing two interpretative essays in the
middle sections of the semester and a semi-cumulative final paper. I
will distribute more specific instructions later in the semester, but
you will write papers on the "Unit 2 -- Atlantic Exchanges and
Economies" and Unit 3 -- Race and Slavery in the Atlantic World."

**Interpretive Paper I**

**Complete Draft Due:** Wednesday, 10/18, (bring a printed copy to
class)

**Final Draft Due:** Monday 10/23 (via Canvas)

**Interpretive Paper II**

**Due:** Wed, 11/29 (via Canvas)

**Final Paper - Interpretive Paper III**

**Due:** Thursday, Dec 14, at 5pm

**These are a minimum of 1500-words** in length, excluding footnotes,
and must follow the style requirements above.

On each paper please include the following: Name, date, and Word Count
in the upper left-hand corner followed by the title centered on the page
(please do not include a title page)

The papers will be formal historical essays, which will be graded on the
thoughtfulness of the argument (thesis) and the degree to which the
thesis is supported by cited evidence. Papers will be based upon the
assigned readings and you are not required to do any additional research
to complete them.

Please submit a copy of the completed draft with the Final Draft (to do
so, *please turn on "Track Changes" in Word* ***after*** *you complete
your initial draft)*. Students are expected to attend all Paper
Workshops.

***Specific instructions for each paper will follow.***

<u>Contribution:</u> Every class period has an assigned reading
and/or will include in-class discussion. Students are expected to attend
class, to have completed the reading, and to be prepared to discuss the
major arguments of the work and their broader implications for our
understanding of the Atlantic World. The instructor reserves the right
to give pop quizzes in these discussion sections should the discussion
not meet his satisfaction.

<u>Grading:</u>

Primary Source Analysis \#1 7.5%

Primary Source Analysis \#2 10%

Paper \#1 15%

Paper \#2 20%

Final Paper 25%

Contribution 15%

Informal Assignments 7.5%

**<u>Policies and Procedures:</u>**

<u>Late Papers:</u> Only late papers accompanied by a valid
excuse (illness with doctor\'s note, university sanctioned
extra-curricular activity, family emergency, etc.) will be accepted
without penalty. All other late papers will be penalized one full letter
grade on the day following the due date (A to B) and one third of a
letter grade (B to B-) for each day after that. Missed assignments will
be assigned a score of zero.

**<u>Academic Integrity</u>: Please do your own work. Plagiarism
will not be tolerated in any form.** The students and faculty of Denison
University are committed to academic integrity and will not tolerate any
violation of this principle.  Academic honesty, the cornerstone of
teaching and learning, lays the foundation for lifelong integrity.

<img src="media/integrity.jpg" alt="Academic Integrity" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 200px;">Academic dishonesty is, in most cases, intellectual theft. It includes,
but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner not
authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for
evaluation. This standard applies to all work ranging from daily
homework assignments to major exams. Students must clearly cite any
sources consulted---not only for quoted phrases but also for ideas and
information that are not common knowledge. Neither ignorance nor
carelessness is an acceptable defense in cases of plagiarism. It is the
student's responsibility to follow the appropriate format for citations.
Students should ask the professor for assistance in determining what
sorts of materials and assistance are appropriate for assignments and
for guidance in citing such materials clearly.

Proposed and developed by Denison students, passed unanimously by DCGA
and Denison's faculty, the **Code of Academic Integrity** requires that
instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic
dishonesty, and it requires that cases be heard by the Academic
Integrity Board. Further, the code makes students responsible for
promoting a culture of integrity on campus and acting in instances in
which integrity is violated. The punishment for plagiarism/academic
dishonesty in this class will be a grade of zero for the assignment in
question and potentially a failing grade for the course in egregious
cases.

<u>Disability Statement:</u> Any student who feels he or she may
need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact
me privately as soon as possible to discuss his or her specific needs. I
rely on the Academic Support & Enrichment Center in 104 Doane to verify
the need for reasonable accommodations.

<u>Writing Center:</u> The Center is a free resource available to
all Denison students.  Student writing consultants from many majors help
writers one-on-one in all phases of the writing process, from
deciphering the assignment, to discussing ideas, to developing an
argument, to finalizing a draft.  Please visit the Writing Center
Website at
[http://www.denison.edu/writingctr/](http://www.denison.edu/writingctr/)
for locations and hours.

<u>L2 or Multilingual Support</u>**:** In addition to the
academic support services available to all Denison students, students
who use English in addition to other languages can meet with Denison's
Coordinator of Multilingual Learning, Kalynda Thayer. If English is not
your first or only language, please consider utilizing this resource,
which is available to ALL Denison students. Ms. Thayer offers a variety
of support for L2 students, including consulting with you about your
written language (grammar, syntax, word-choices), strategies to manage
your reading assignments, assistance with class conversation and
presentations, and to help devising ways to develop and effectively use
all your skills in English. You can email her at thayerk\@denison.edu to
schedule an appointment.

**<u>The course adheres to Denison's Academic Credit
Policy</u>** Significant feedback on writing is a core
component of this course. Students are expected to review instructor
feedback and reflect on how to incorporate that into their future work.
Students will be required to complete pre- or post-writing assignments
before and after official course meetings.

<u>Classroom Etiquette:</u> Please arrive to class on time, and
please turn off and put away your phones. Any student found using any
form of social media on their phones during class will be asked to
leave. Computers may not be used in class.

## AI Statement

The development of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard are transforming the landscape of higher education. With that reality in mind, here are some guiding principles for the use of AI **in our course** (other faculty may have different policies, and it is YOUR responsibility to know what each of your professors determine is the acceptable and ethical use of AI in their courses).

- **RECOGNIZE that my primary interest is to know what YOU THINK** about the materials I have assigned. (I don't care what a computer might produce as representing the "hive mind" or "groupthink" best answer to a question based on what others have written.)

  - AI might be appropriate as a piece of the process of identifying a topic and theme to write your papers on. It might be helpful to identify the author and their historical context to better understand your source(s). But, it **should not be used** to produce the final product (Please don't ask AI to "write a paper" for you, you're only cheating yourself)

  - If you consult AI, Academic Integrity requires that you **ACKNOWLEDGE** such use to your readers. Do so in a footnote. In a sentence, explain your use of AI and identify the tool(s) you consulted.

    - Do not CITE AI. Citations are meant to identify the work of other humans that you have consulted, and to provide a clear path to your evidence for your readers should they want to consult it themselves. AI-produced information is not reproducible, and thus is not a valid source.

- **DO NOT** input/upload any personal information to AI. Do not provide your D#, SSN#, Passport#, Slayter box #, telephone number, etc. to AI

- **DO NOT** *UPLOAD* any course materials or assigned reading to AI. Doing so may violate the Denison Code of Academic Integrity and Federal Copyright Law.

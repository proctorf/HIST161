# Piracy and Privateering in the Atlantic World: A Complete Chronology

## **Early Period: Corsairs & Sea Dogs (1500s-1600s)**

### **Corsairs (1500s-1560s)**
- **French state-sponsored raiders** with royal commissions against Spanish shipping
- **Pure maritime operations** - professional naval crews living entirely on ships
- **Naval warfare focus** - systematic attacks on treasure fleets and coastal settlements
- **Formal military discipline** and organization under national authority

### **Sea Dogs (1560s-1603)**
- **English equivalent to corsairs** - Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Martin Frobisher
- **Elizabeth I's "unofficial navy"** against Spanish Empire
- **Professional sailors** with quasi-naval structure and royal backing
- **Strategic objectives** beyond mere profit - weakening Spanish power

### **Early Freebooters (1600s-1640s)**
- **Dutch vrijbuiters** during independence wars against Spain
- **Ship-based operations** but with looser state control than corsairs
- **Transition period** between formal naval warfare and buccaneer communities

## **Buccaneer Era: Land-Sea Communities (1640s-1690s)**

### **Buccaneers (1640s-1690s)**
- **Shore-based communities** - Tortuga, Port Royal, later Madagascar
- **Mixed economy**: hunting, farming, trading, AND raiding
- **Democratic governance** - elected captains, formal articles and codes
- **Multi-ethnic crews** including escaped slaves, indigenous peoples, European outcasts
- **Quasi-legitimate status** - sometimes held commissions, often operated independently
- **Examples**: Henry Morgan's Panama raid (1671), Port Royal's golden age

**Key Events:**
- **1670**: Treaty of Madrid attempts to end English buccaneering
- **1692**: Port Royal earthquake disperses Caribbean buccaneer community

## **Golden Age: Pirates & Revolutionary Privateers (1690s-1730s)**

### **Freebooters/Pirates Proper (1690s-1730s)**
- **Ship-based criminal enterprises** with no legal authority
- **Purely profit-driven** - operating outside any national framework
- **Temporary associations** - crews formed and dissolved quickly
- **Often former buccaneers/privateers** turned fully criminal after wars ended
- **Examples**: Blackbeard (Edward Teach), Bartholomew Roberts, "Calico Jack" Rackham

### **American Revolutionary Privateers (1775-1783): "Patriot Pirates"**

**Character**: **Legal privateers with revolutionary legitimacy**
- **Continental Congress & state commissions** - ~2,000 privateering commissions issued
- **Massive scale**: ~18,000 American privateers vs. 3,000 Continental Navy sailors
- **British perspective**: American privateers were **rebels/pirates** since they didn't recognize American sovereignty
- **American perspective**: **Legitimate naval warfare** against British commerce
- **Economic warfare**: Captured ~3,000 British vessels, Â£18 million in losses

**Notable figures**: 
- **Joshua Barney** - Baltimore privateer captain
- **Jonathan Haraden** - Massachusetts privateer with 1,000+ prisoners captured

**Blurred lines**: Some operated **beyond their commissions**, raiding neutral ships or continuing after peace

## **Decline and Later Privateering (1720s-1856)**

### **Suppression Era (1720s-1730s)**
- **Coordinated naval campaigns** by European powers
- **Mass trials and executions** - hundreds of pirates hanged
- **1722**: Death of Bartholomew Roberts marks effective end of Golden Age piracy

### **Intermittent Privateering Revival (1739-1815)**
- **War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748)**
- **Seven Years' War (1756-1763)**
- **Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815)**
- **War of 1812** - American privateers again raid British commerce

### **Final End**
- **1856**: Declaration of Paris formally abolishes privateering among European powers

## **Key Distinctions Summary**

| Type | Period | Base | Authority | Character |
|------|--------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Corsairs/Sea Dogs** | 1500s-1600s | Ships only | State commissions | Professional naval warfare |
| **Buccaneers** | 1640s-1690s | Shore communities | Semi-legitimate | Democratic societies with mixed economy |
| **Pirates** | 1690s-1730s | Ships only | None (criminal) | Pure criminal enterprise |
| **Revolutionary Privateers** | 1775-1783 | Ships only | Revolutionary state | Legal rebels/illegal pirates (depending on perspective) |

The **American Revolutionary period** represents a unique case where **legitimate privateering and piracy blurred together**, with the same acts viewed as **patriotic naval service** or **criminal piracy** depending on which side of the Atlantic you stood.
